90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text did not have automatic tags and all the tags are
    added manually. 2- I used the ### $ as a simplified tag for dictionary items.
    Most of these dictionary items are names/adjectives attributed to the places (or
    tribes) with ‘y’ nisba (like “الجليلي” which is somebody or something from
    “الجليل”, a mountain in Yemen), but there are also some other types of words
    (like “السوفسطائي” = sophist, or “الموسيقي” = music, or lesser-known laqabs of
    people). I think we can’t tag these items separately and all these simplified
    tags must ultimately be replaced by the complete tag for lexical entries (i.e.
    ### $DIC_LEX$). Even the first example above cannot be considered a toponym
    (because it is “الجليلي”, not “الجليل”). 2- In some cases, after explaining
    about the place or word, the author names people who are from that place or
    whose names are attributed to that word. Such names are not part of the
    structure and need to be tagged inside the text.
    All paratextual elements
