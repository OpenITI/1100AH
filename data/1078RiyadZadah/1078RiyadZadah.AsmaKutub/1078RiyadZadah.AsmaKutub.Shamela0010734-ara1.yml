90#VERS#COMMENT##: The ### $ tag is used for the names of books in this
    text. The text did not have automatic tags and all the tags are added
    manually. I checked all the entries to be in separate lines.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
